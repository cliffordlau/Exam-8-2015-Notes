## Cliff's Summary

### Gillam & Snader 3

Know the [4 assumptions](#discountass) for discount method

Know [assumptions](#xmedass) behind the x-med formula

Know how to setup formula based on what's given

* Take out ALAE from loss if needed

Know the deductible formulas

### Teng

Know the by component calculations of premium

* Apply $\phi^{LLM}(r)$ to the right basis (limited or unlimited loss)
    * Charge from a Table LLM would naturally be expressed as a percent of expected limited losses
* $EEL$ is usually $EL$ times XS factor
* As % of standard premium vs final premium

Know the difference between XS and LDD

* For [Loss](#XSvLDD-Loss), [LAE](#XSvLDD-LAE), [G&A](#XSvLDD-GA), [Acq](#XSvLDD-acq), [risk load](#XSvLDD-risk), [tax](#XSvLDD-tax), [profit & contingencies](#XSvLDD-profit)

* 2002 Q2 (x-med discount assumptions)
* 2012 Q22 c$\star$ (XS layer trend higher, B7)

### Teng

LDD Prem

* 2000 Q38 ab $\star$ (full blown LDD)
    * LBA is an expense
* 2002 Q1 (plug and play)

Concepts

* 2000 Q38 c $\star$ (LDD vs XS)
* 2001 Q12 (LDD considerations)
* 2002 Q44 $\star$ (LDD vs XS)
    * d: higher uncertainty of loss for XS so higher ELF

## Must Know Formulas

LDD by components

* $\text{LDD Prem} = \dfrac{ (EEL + \phi^{LLM}(r_G) \times EPL) + EL \: (ULAE + LBA) + SP \: (GO + CR)}{1 - A - T - p}$

XS by components

* $\text{XS Prem} = \dfrac{(EEL + \phi^{LLM}(r_G) \times EPL) \times (1 + ULAE) + SP \: (GO)}{1 - A - T - p}$

***

Straight Deductible

* $PLER = \dfrac{L_r + (N-n)r}{L}$

Disappearing Deductible

* $PLER = \dfrac{L_r + L_R - (L_R - rN_R)\frac{R}{R-r}}{L}$

$\begin{array}{ll}
  L_r &=  \text{Total losses from claims with loss size }\leq r \\
  N &= \text{Total # of claims} \\
  n &= \text{Total # of claims with loss size }\leq r \\
  r &= \text{Deductible amount} \\
  L &= \text{Total losses} \\
  & \\
  &\text{For Disappearing only} \\
  & \\
  L_R &=  \text{Total losses from claims with loss size } r < \lambda < R \\
  N_R &=  \text{Total # of claims with loss size } r < \lambda < R \\
\end{array}$

***

LDD by discount

* $D = \dfrac{(ELR)(PLER)(f)}{1-A-T-p}$

XS by discount varies with Net Premium

* $D = \dfrac{(ELR)(PLER)(f)}{1 - A - T - p - u - i - gh}$

XS by discount varies with XS L&ALAE

* $D = \dfrac{(ELR)(PLER)(f)(1+u_E+i_E+g_E h_E)}{1 - A - T - p}$

ULAE$(u)$, Inspection Expense$(i)$, and Portion$(g)$ of Home Office Expense$(h)$

***

X-med policies by discount

* $P = \dfrac{E - kE_M+ eP}{1-A-T}$

Adj under retro rating x-med

* $C' = 1 + (C - 1)\dfrac{1-A-T-e}{(1-D)(1-A-T)-e}$
