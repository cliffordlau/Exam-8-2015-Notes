## Intro to LDD and XS Policies

Usually requires employers to be very large, especially for XS policies since they have to service those policies

Both are less regulated than

### Adventages of LDD and XS policies

Insured's POV:

* Save costs related to insurer profit and expenses
* Tax savings since liability for an insurance deductible on an unpaid insurance claim can be deducted, but not loss reserve on a retained claim

Insurer's POV:

* Positive cash flow since XS claims don't paid out for years
* Lower residual market assessments if those assessments are based on written premium

### Large Dollar Deductible Overview

Employer:

* Self-retain a per occ deductible and/or aggregate deductible

Insurer:

* Indemnifies all losses > deductible
* Provides services = full coverage
* Adjusts all claims
* Issue as endorsement to full coverage

Additional Pros:

* Medium size employers can qualify
* No administration effort
* Savings on taxes and assessments
    * Losses below the deductible do not generate premium, which is subject to these taxes and assessments
* Already familiar with insurer's level of service
* Insurer might be best qualified to provide policy and claim services

### XS Policy Overview

Employer:

* Self-retain a per occ deductible and/or aggregate deductible
* Service the plan internally (or use TPA)

Insurer:

* Indemnifies all losses > deductible
* Only involve with claims that may exceed deductible
* Issue as a stand-alone policies

Additional Pros:

* Expenses paid to TPA are not considered insurance premium so not subject to premium based taxes and assessment

### LDD and XS Policies Rating Method Overview

Mostly retrospectively rated since the retro premium can vary with actual costs instead of based on uncertain expected costs $\Rightarrow$ More stable stream of income for insurers; Increase equity in costs across insureds

2 way to price:

* Summing up the cost components
    * More justifiable and more appealing to customers
* Discount from full coverage
    * Assumes full coverage premium is adequate (or apply factor for rate adequacy)
    
## LDD and XS Policies Cost Components  

Loss + ALAE + ULAE + Overhead + Acquisition + Risk Load + Taxes & Assessments + Profit & Contingencies

### Loss  
<span style="color:green">2013 Q18</span>

Mostly similar between LDD and XS with 1 exception:  
Insurer’s exposure is dependent on the prudence of the TPA’s claim handling $\Rightarrow$ Additional uncertainty will be priced in

$\begin{array}{lc}
  \text{XS Loss Cost} = &\text{Losses }>\text{ per occ deductible} \\
  &+ \\
  &\text{Agg primary losses }> \text{ agg deductible}\\
\end{array}$

3 methods to price similar to retro rated policies

1. Tbl LLM for agg charge + ELPPF for per occ charge
2. Tbl M with ICRLL for agg charge + ELPPF for per occ charge
3. Tbl L for both

Losses may or may not be rated with ALAE, deal with it appropriately. E.g. Use ELAEPPF for Tbl LLM and M

#### Considerations when Using ELPPFs

ELPPFs only vary by limit and HG and state $\Rightarrow$ Might not be appropriate for all insured

Nature of insured's business might be different than the HG (Also affects the charge)

Insured’s prior loss history, particularly of serious injuries as they are more likely to pierce the limit

Insured's safety and managed care

Overlap between ELPPF and charge (Already accounted for in the method)

ELPPF vs ELAEPPF

#### Fisher Comments

Estimate of expected losses below the deductible is too low:

1. The % error in insurance charges is greatest for large policies w/ high entry ratios
    * As $r$ $\uparrow$, ratio for the 2 area $\uparrow$
    * As policies size $\uparrow$, curve flatter $\Rightarrow$ smaller areas above same $r$
2. The \$ error in insurance charges is greatest for large policies w/ low entry ratios
    * Area between the curves and above $r$ largest for low values of $r$
    * \$ value greater when this difference in area is multiplied by a larger expected loss

### LAE

LDD LAE $\gg$ XS LAE since insurer handles all claims

LDD

* ALAE rated with loss
* ULAE rated with unlimited loss

XS

* Split pro rata on losses above and below deductible
* ULAE rated with XS loss

### General Overhead Expenses

E.g. home office admin, policy production, underwriting, actuarial, IT costs, and statistical reporting

LDD G&A > XS G&A since services are only provided for claims above the deductible

LDD G&A can be > full coverage:

* Insurer has to seek reimbursement for losses < deductible
* Complicated data reporting
* Separately LDD endorsement
* Computer system needs to handle these policies

G&A as % of **Standard Premium**

* Expense loads in pricing should vary by risk size to account for fixed costs
* In full coverage this is handled by the premium discount

### Acquisition Expense

E.g. Sales commissions and sales office expenses

Structure varies by company so should be priced accordingly

Acq Expense as % of **Net Premium**

### Risk Load  
<span style="color:green">2003 Q34</span>

LDD and XS are riskier than full coverage:

* XS loss harder to estimate
* Higher interest rate risk $\because$ Longer payout period
    * 4-5 years duration for LDD; 10+ years for XS
* Credit risk for LDD only
    * Vary based on insured and collateral

Might need cat reinsurance, so the cost of that

*Credit risk* as % of **Standard Premium**

Rest are part of profit & contingencies

### Taxes and Assessments

Based on net premium or net loss (Sometimes group-up loss and full coverage premium)

XS plan are treated more like XS GL than WC

* No residual market assessments or loss based assessments
* Lower premium tax rate

### Profit & Contingencies

LDD

* Compete on services and price

XS

* Compete on price only
* Profit margin usually negative
* Made up in investment income

Profit & Cont as % of **Net Premium**

## Insurance Charge and Loss Elimination Ratio  
<span style="color:green">2007 Q33</span>

Insurance Charge

**For policy with both per occ and agg deductible**

Fisher:

* Use LLM or Tbl M w/ ICRLL to price agg charge
* Charge is applied to the $\mathrm{E}[Loss_{primary}; \text{Per occ limit}]$ to get \$ charge

Teng:

* Converts table charge to be % of expected $\mathrm{E}[Loss_{group-up}]$ and applies $\mathrm{E}[Loss_{group-up}]$

Just make sure you're applying charges to the right kind of loss

**Loss Elimination Ratio**

* In retro rating: $\dfrac{\mathrm{E}[Loss > occ]}{\mathrm{E}[Loss]}
* Gillam & Snader 3 (LDD and XS): $\dfrac{\mathrm{E}[Loss < occ]}{\mathrm{E}[Loss]}
* Difference due to looking at different POV, both are losses that are eliminated

## Pricing LDD: By Components  
<span style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Important Formulas</span>

$\text{LDD Prem} = \dfrac{ {\color{blue}{(EEL + \phi^{LLM}(r_G) \times EPL) } } + EL \: (ULAE + LBA) + SP \: (GO + CR)}{1 - A - T - p}$

**Loss**  
${\color{blue}{(EEL + \phi^{LLM}(R_G) \times EPL) } }$:

$\begin{array}{ll}
  EL &= \text{Expected ground-up L&ALAE} \\
  EPL &= \text{Expected primary L&ALAE} \\
  &= EL \times LER \\
  EEL &= \text{Expected XS L&ALAE} \\
  &= EL - EPL \\
  r_G &= \dfrac{Deductible_{Agg}}{EPL} \\
  \phi^{LLM}(r_G) &= \text{Insurance charge for aggregate deductible} \\
\end{array}$

**As a % of Group-up Losses**

$\begin{array}{ll}
  ULAE &= \text{Provision for ULAE} \\
  LBA &= \text{Loss based assessment} \\
\end{array}$

**As a % of Standard Premium**

$\begin{array}{ll}
  GO &= \text{General & Admin Expense} \\
  CR &= \text{Credit Risk} \\
\end{array}$

**As a % of Net Premium**

$\begin{array}{ll}
  A &= \text{Acquisition Expense} \\
  T &= \text{Taxes and Premium Based Assessments} \\
  p &= \text{Profit and Contingencies} \\
\end{array}$

***

$\phi^{LLM}(r)$

* Is the charge that should cover losses in XS of $r$ times expected primary losses
* Make sure you know if this is expressed as % of either ground-up or primary and apply to the appropriate loss amount

Full coverage the loss portion is just $CR$ and without $CR$

LDD LR $\ll$ Full Coverage LR, usually <50%
LDD Expense $\gg$ Full Coverage LR, usually >50%

## Pricing XS Policies: By Components

$\text{XS Prem} = \dfrac{ {\color{blue}{(EEL + \phi^{LLM}(r_G) \times EPL) } } \times (1 + ULAE) + SP \: (GO)}{1 - A - T - p}$

**Differences from LDD:**  
<span style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Important Concepts</span>

* $ULAE$ is related to XS Loss
* No $CR$ and $LBA$
* $GO$ smaller since only service XS portion
* $T$ smaller since not treated as WC
* $p$ smaller due to purely price competition

***

XS LR $\gg$ LDD LR, usually >70%

XS Expense $\ll$ LDD Expense, usually <20%

## Pricing LDD and XS Policies as a Discount off Full-Coverage

Need to calculate the discount in 2 steps:

1. Determine the loss elimination ratio for the per-occurrence retention.
2. Make expense assumptions, and determine the discount corresponding to the LER.

### Implicit Assumptions  
<span style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Important Concepts</span>

**1. Safety factor**

* Applies to LER
* Reflects that LER might not be fully realized e.g. credit risk

**2. Same LAE and G&A**

* For full vs LDD, everything is same
* For full vs XS, some items were allowed to vary with XS loss or net premium

**3. Acquisition costs, taxes, and profit are the same % to final premium**

* For full vs LDD vs XS
* Not realistic for XS since they are taxed at lower rates and lower profit margin

**4. Only per occ deductible and no agg**

Can relax assumption 1. and 4.

### Calculating Loss Elimination Ratio

Interested in Primary LER, losses below the deductible over total losses

#### Straight Deductible

Fixed dollar amount, losses < $r$ are fully eliminated and losses > $r$ are reduced by $r$

<span style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Important Formulas</span>

$\begin{array}{ll}
  PLER &= \dfrac{L_r + (N-n)r}{L} \\
  L_r &=  \text{Total losses from claims with loss size }\leq r \\
  N &= \text{Total # of claims} \\
  n &= \text{Total # of claims with loss size }\leq r \\
  r &= \text{Deductible amount} \\
  L &= \text{Total losses} \\
\end{array}$

#### Disappearing Deductible

* Claims < $r$ are fully eliminated
* Deductible $\downarrow$ linearly between $r$ and $R$
* Claims > $R$ have no deductible

<span style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Important Formulas</span>

$\begin{array}{ll}
  PLER &= \dfrac{L_r + L_R - (L_R - rN_R)\frac{R}{R-r}}{L} \\
  L_r &=  \text{Total losses from claims with loss size } r < \lambda < R \\
  N_r &=  \text{Total # of claims with loss size } r < \lambda < R \\
\end{array}$

***

Tempered Loss Elimination Ratio = $f \times PLER$

* $f$ = safety factor

### Pricing LDD: Discount

$\text{Discount} = D = \dfrac{(ELR)(PLER)(f)}{1-A-T-p}$<span style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Memorize Formula</span>

*Proof:*

$\begin{array}{lll}
  D &= 1 - \dfrac{P'}{P} &\text{by definition} \\
  &= 1 - \dfrac{ (EEL + \phi^{LLM}(r_G) \times EPL) + EL \: (ULAE + LBA) + SP \: (GO + CR)}{(EL) + EL \: (ULAE + LBA) + SP \: (GO)} &\text{From Pricing LDD: By Components}\\
  &= \dfrac{EL - \left[EEL + \phi^{LLM}(r_G) \times EPL\right] - SP(CR)}{(EL) + EL \: (ULAE + LBA) + SP \: (GO)} \\
  &= \dfrac{ {\color{blue}{EL}} - \left[{\color{blue}{EEL}} + \phi^{LLM}(r_G) \times {\color{blue}{EPL}}\right] - SP(CR)}{P(1-A-T-p)} & \text{From definition of }P \\
  &= \dfrac{ {\color{blue}{P(ELR)}} - \left[{\color{blue}{P(ELR)(1-PLER)}} + \phi^{LLM}(r_G) \times {\color{blue}{(P)(ELR)(PLER)}}\right] - SP(CR)}{P(1-A-T-p)} & \text{Restate losses with LR and }P \\
  &= \dfrac{P(ELR) - P(ELR)(1-PLER) - SP(CR)}{P(1-A-T-p)} & \text{Assumption 4. No agg deductible }\Rightarrow \phi^{LLM}(r_G) = 0 \\
  &= \dfrac{P(ELR)(PLER) - SP(CR)}{P(1-A-T-p)}\\
  &= \dfrac{P(ELR)(PLER)(f)}{P(1-A-T-p)} &\text{Assumption 1. Use safety factor for credit risk}\\
  &= \dfrac{(ELR)(PLER)(f)}{1-A-T-p} &\text{Final formula }{\color{red}{Memorize}}\\
\end{array}$

Make sure we're consistent with all the factors on whether we include ALAE or not

## Pricing XS Policies: Discount

Formula depends on what does **ULAE**$(u)$, **Inspection Expense**$(i)$, and **Portion**$(g)$ of **Home Office Expense**$(h)$ varies with

**Additional Assumptions:**

1. No LBA
2. ALAE rated with losses
3. Rest of G&A are the same between full and XS

Varies with **Net Premium**:

$D = \dfrac{(ELR)(PLER)(f)}{1 - A - T - p - u - i - gh}$

Varies with **XS L&ALAE**

$D = \dfrac{(ELR)(PLER)(f)(1+u_E+i_E+g_E h_E)}{1 - A - T - p}$

## Pricing X-Med Policies: Discount

**Assumptions:**  
<span style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Important</span>

1. X-Med Pure Premium = Full Coverage PP - **Portion** of Medical PP
    * Selection of X-Med will likely be adverse to the insurer
    * Some medical cost may still be required based on court interpretation
    * Insurer retains obligation if employer is unable to pay
2. Taxes and acquisition costs vary with net premium; Else stays the same

***

**Discount:**

$\begin{array}{ll}
  D &= 1 - \dfrac{P'}{P} \\
  &= \dfrac{1-A-T-e}{1-A-T} \times \dfrac{kE_M}{E} \\
\end{array}$

**Full coverage:**

$P = \dfrac{E + eP}{1-A-T}$

**X-Med:**

$P = \dfrac{E - kE_M+ eP}{1-A-T}$

***

$\begin{array}{ll}
  E &= \text{Expected total PP xLAE} \\
  e &= \text{Expense & profit including LAE but x}A \& T \\
  A &= \text{Acquisition cost} \\
  T &= \text{Taxes} \\
  E_M &= \text{Expected Med PP} \\
  k &= \text{Portion of Med pp to eliminate} \\
\end{array}$

***

### Adjustments Under Retro Rating for X-Med

$C' = 1 + (C - 1)\dfrac{1-A-T-e}{(1-D)(1-A-T)-e}$  
<span style="color:red">Never tested... Memorize</span>

***

Need to adjust $LCF$ if still assume same LAE for X-Med and Full

**Assumption:**

* ALAE not rated with losses
* LAE portion of retro premium for Full coverage is $(LCF-1)Loss$
* LAE portion of retro premium for X-Med is $(LCF'-1)Loss_{XM}$

Keep the same LAE dollars:

$\begin{array}{lll}
  (C' - 1)L_{XM} &= (C-1)L \\
  C' &= 1 + (C - 1)\frac{L}{L_{XM}} \\
  &= 1 + (C - 1)\frac{E}{E_{XM}} &\text{Convert losses to PP by dividing by exposures} \\
  &= 1 + (C - 1)\frac{E}{E - kE_{M}} \\
  &= \vdots \\
  C' &= 1 + (C - 1)\dfrac{1-A-T-e}{(1-D)(1-A-T)-e}\\
\end{array}$
