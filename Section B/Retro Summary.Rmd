## Cliff's Summary

### Lee 2

Know how the entry ratio, charges and other relationships are represented as areas in the graph

* [Tbl M Charges](#tblmfigure1)
* [Tbl M Charges and savings](#tblmfigure4))
* [Table LLM](#tblllmfigure1)
* [Table L](#tbllfigure1)

Different forms of the charge and properties

### Gillam & Snader 2

Using NCCI Table M

* Need Adj Expected Loss to get ELG to get know the column of Tbl M

Remember the basic premium formula only works if plan is balanced

* $b = e - (C - 1)\mathrm{E}[A] + CI$

Know how to build Table M

Know how to plug and play with all the equations

## Must Know Formulas

### Table M

Net Charge:

* $I = \mathrm{E}[A][\phi(r_G) - \psi(r_H)]$

Other Relationships:

* $\dfrac{\mathrm{E}[L]}{\mathrm{E}[A]} = 1 + \psi(r_H) - \phi(r_G)$

### Reading Table M

Adjusted Expected Losses:

* $= \mathrm{E}[A] \times \text{State HG Differential} \times \dfrac{1 + 0.8k}{1-k}$

### Retro premium related

GCP:

* $\text{Guaranteed Cost Premium} = (e + \mathrm{E}[A])T = (1-D)P$

Basic premium is balanced plan:

* $b = e - (C - 1)\mathrm{E}[A] + CI$

## Questions

What is the x-axis for the Table LLM

What is the state differential in finding the Adjusted Expected Loss
