## ISO Experience Mod Formula  
<span style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Important Formulas</span>

$Mod = Z \times \dfrac{AER - EER}{EER}$

$Z = \text{Credibility}$

$\begin{array}{ll}
  AER &= \text{Actual Experience Ratio} \\
  &= \dfrac{\text{Actual Reported @ }\textbf{Basic Limits}\text{ L&ALAE }\textbf{Limited by MSL } + \text{ Expected Unreported}}{\text{Expected Ult @ }\textbf{Basic Limit}\text{ L&ALAE }\textbf{Not}\text{ Limited by MSL}}
\end{array}$

$\begin{array}{ll}
  EER &= \text{Expected Experience Ratio} \\
  &= \dfrac{\text{Expected Ult @ }\textbf{Basic Limits}\text{ L&ALAE }\textbf{Limited by MSL }}{\text{Expected Ult @ }\textbf{Basic Limit}\text{ L&ALAE }\textbf{Not}\text{ Limited by MSL}}
\end{array}$

***Notes on ISO Exp Mod***  
<span style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Important Details</span>

Company Subject Loss Cost (CSLC) = Denominator of both $AER$ and $EER$

Without MSL $\Rightarrow$ $EER = 1$ since top and bottom only difference by the MSL

EER is conceptually similar to NCCI's D-Ratio

No-split plan

$Mod$ is not produced in factor form $\Rightarrow$ Need to add 1 to use

The ISO plan responds primarily to **frequency** and less to severity

* Only uses losses @ **basic** policy limits
* Ignores XS losses above basic limit
* Additional cap, Maximum Single Loss, on top of the basic limits

Uses 3 years of actual experience $sim$ NCCI

## Calculation of CSLC

Company Subject Loss Cost = $\mathrm{E}[L]$ + Basic Policy Limits + $Adj_{Trend}$ + $Adj_{Coverage}$

* So that $\mathrm{E}[L]$ comparable to historical

3 methods to calculate CSLC

* Use standard method unless there is dramatic $\Delta$ in exposures besides inflation

### Standard Method

Data Requirement:  
**Annual premium** for each **subline** for the **prospective** period @**Basic Limit** prior to any individual risk mod

**Rule 5A** defines basic limits

**Rule 10** Step 1-3 if no premium

***

$CSLC = \sum\limits_{y=1}^3 \sum\limits_{sl} CSLC_{y,sl}$

$\begin{array}{llll}
  CSLC_{y,sl} &= BLEL_{sl} &\times &\cdots (1) \\
  &= [\text{Table 13 B }PAF]_{sl} &\times &\cdots (2) \\
  &= [\text{Table 13 C }PAF]_{y, sl} &\times &\cdots (3) \\
  &= Detrend_{y, sl} & &\cdots(4) \\
\end{array}$

$(1)$ $BLEL$ by subline

* $\text{Basic Limits Expected Losses}_{sl} = \text{Company }ELR \times \text{Annual Basic Limits Company Premium}_{sl}$

$(2)$ Convert to occurrence level (only when policy rated is CM)

* Based on prospective period policy type
* Based on the year in CM program (1-4, mature) for the prospective policy period

$(3)$ Convert to level matching historical actual

* Based on experience period policy type
* Based on the year in CM program (1-4, mature) for the historical policy period

$(4)$ Detrend to same level as historical

* Account for both pure premium and exposure trend
* By subline and year of experience
* Use the column in Table 14 related to Rule 5B

### Present Average Company Rate Method  
<span style="color:green">2007 Q27</span>

Additional Requirements:  
Special u/w exposure base

***

$CSLC = \sum\limits_{y=1}^3 \sum\limits_{sl} CSLC_{y,sl}$

$\begin{array}{llll}
  CSLC_{y,sl} &= AvgPrem_{sl} &\times &\cdots (1) \\
  &= SpecialExposures_y &\times &\cdots (2) \\
  &= ELR &\times &\cdots (3) \\
  &= [\text{Table 13 B }PAF]_{sl} &\times &\cdots (4) \\
  &= [\text{Table 13 C }PAF]_{y, sl} &\times &\cdots (5) \\
  &= Detrend_{y, sl} & &\cdots(6) \\
\end{array}$

$(1)$ $\dfrac{\text{Annual Company Premium @ Basic Limit by subline for new policy period}}{\text{Special u/w exposure}}$

$(2)$ Special underwriting exposure base use for both policy period rated and experience periods

$(1) \times (2) \times (3) =$ Basic Level Loss Cost

$(3), (4), (5)$ Same as Standard Method

$(6)$ Only adjust for PP trend

* Use the column in Table 14 related to Rule 5C
* Since using $(1)$ we don't need to trend exposure

### Historical Exposures @ Present Company Rates Method

Additional Requirements:  
Actual exposures by **class** + **location** + **year** + **subline** of the experience period

***

$CSLC = \sum\limits_{y=1}^3 \sum\limits_{sl} CSLC_{y,sl}$

$CSLC_{y,sl} = Premium_{y,sl} \times ELR \times Detrend_{y,sl}$

$Premium_{y,sl} = \sum\limits_{class, location} \left\{Exposure_{actual} \times [\text{Current Basic Limit Company Rates}] \times ILF_{\text{basic per occ limits and actual policy annual agg limits}}\right\}$

* Use the column in Table 14 related to Rule 5C
* Using current rates for the policy type in each year of the experience $\Rightarrow$ No need for Table 13B and 13C PAFs

## Completing Mod Calculation

With CSLC, lookup $EER$, $MSL$, $Z$ from *Table 16*

If $Z \geq 0.03 \: \Rightarrow$ Schedule Rating

If $Z \geq 0.07 \: \Rightarrow$ Experience Rating

### AER

Numerator is BF estimate of ult @ basic limits L&ALAE limited by the MSL

$\begin{array}{ll}
  AER &= \text{Actual Experience Ratio} \\
  &= \dfrac{\text{Actual Reported @ }\textbf{Basic Limits}\text{ L&ALAE }\textbf{Limited by MSL } + \text{ Expected Unreported}}{CSLC}
\end{array}$

***1. Actual historical L&ALAE @ basic limits and the MSL***

Data Requirements:  
Historical L&ALAE data for the experience period with claims level details split into loss and ALAE

1. **Basic limit loss**: Basic per occ limit (from Rule 5A) for **loss** only
2. **MSL**: $\min \left( \text{Basic Limit Loss + ALAE}, MSL \right)$ 

Annual agg limits in Rule 5A are NOT applied according to Rule 5D part 1 <span style="color:red">What?</span>

***2. Expected future loss development from experience period L&ALAE***

Not based on actual historical losses

$\text{Expected Development}_{y,sl} = \sum\limits_{y=1}^3 \sum\limits_{sl} CSLC_{y,sl} \times EER \times LDF_{y,sl}$

$LDF$

* Really just % unreported
* Age: Starting of historical policy term to data evaluation date
* Company *or* ISO in Table 15 *or* Table 11B
* If historical policies is CM always $LDF = 0$

## Miscellaneous items in ISO Manual (Neve tested)

Rule 5H:  
Adj historical loss experience to match deductible level of prospective policy

Rule 8:  
If ELR for company manual premium for the class $\neq$ actual ELR for the risk, multiply the premium after the mod by the *Expense Variation Factor (EVF)*

Rule 12:  
Converting the plan from a loss cost basis to a premium basis

## Schedule Rating

For underwriters to adjust the premium for individual risks based on risk characteristics not reflected in the premium calculation and experience rating

Require $Z \geq 0.03$

List of risk characteristics to be considered with max/min for each category and then summed together with a total max/min

Credit or debit is given in each category if the risk is either above average or below average related to other risks for that category

<span style="color:red">All in manual</span>

Rule 9

| Category | Description and Max/Min |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Location | Exposure inside and out $\pm 5\%$ each for inside and outside |
| Premise | Condition and care $\pm 10\%$ |
| Equipment | Type, condition and care $\pm 10\%$ |
| Classification | Peculiarities $\pm 10\%$ |
| Employees | Selection, training, supervision, experience $\pm 6\%$ |
| Cooperation | Medical facilities and safety program $\pm 2%$ each for med and safety |

Total cap @ $\pm 25%$

## Relation to Experience Rating

Need to avoid reflecting any risk characteristics that are already fully reflected in experience rating

Schedule mod is applied after the experience mod
