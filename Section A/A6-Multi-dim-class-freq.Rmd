## Intro

Price XS and retro rated WC with ELFs (by state + limit)

Challenges:  
ELFs hard to estimate since losses driven by small \# of very large claims

Solution:  
Use correlations between different injury types to build a model based on less-severe injuries for which more data exists

* The key idea is that since the physical circumstances are similar for significant injury types, claim frequencies between those injury types are correlated

This also shows that the current NCCI practice of using the same ELFs for all classes within a hazard group can be further refined
