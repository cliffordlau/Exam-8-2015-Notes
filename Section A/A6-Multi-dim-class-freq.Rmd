## Intro

Price XS and retro rated WC with ELFs (by state + limit)

Challenges:  
ELFs hard to estimate since losses driven by small \# of very large claims

Solution:  
Use correlations between different injury types to build a model based on less-severe injuries for which more data exists

* The key idea is that since the physical circumstances are similar for significant injury types, claim frequencies between those injury types are correlated

This also shows that the current NCCI practice of using the same ELFs for all classes within a hazard group can be further refined

Focuse on the frequencies relativities

* Same accident can produce any injuries $\Rightarrow$ Correlation between relative frequency for different injury types

* Can use more data (from smaller injury) to better predict larger claims from more infrequent types

## Injury Types Definition

In the order of increasing severity  
(Frequency generally goes $\downarrow$ as you move down the list)

$\begin{align}
  \text{Med} &= \text{Med Only}\\
  \text{TT} &= \text{Temporary Total}\\
  \text{Minor PP} &= \text{Minor Permanent Partial}\\
  \text{Minor PP} &= \text{Minor Permanent Partial} &= Y\\
  \text{Major PP} &= \text{Major Permanent Partial} &= X\\
  \text{PT} &= \text{Permanent Total} &= W\\
  \text{F} &= \text{Fatal} &= V\\
\end{align}$

## Variables in the Analysis

Looks at $\dfrac{\text{Claim Counts}_{Type}}{TT}$
  
* For every class code within the HG
* Look at TT claim as an exposure that could produce more severe claim
