## Intro

Price XS and retro rated WC with ELFs (by state + limit)

Challenges:  
ELFs hard to estimate since losses driven by small \# of very large claims

Solution:  
Use correlations between different injury types to build a model based on less-severe injuries for which more data exists

* The key idea is that since the physical circumstances are similar for significant injury types, claim frequencies between those injury types are correlated

This also shows that the current NCCI practice of using the same ELFs for all classes within a hazard group can be further refined

Focuse on the frequencies relativities

* Same accident can produce any injuries $\Rightarrow$ Correlation between relative frequency for different injury types

* Can use more data (from smaller injury) to better predict larger claims from more infrequent types

## Injury Types Definition

In the order of increasing severity  
(Frequency generally goes $\downarrow$ as you move down the list, except PT is more severe than Fatal)

$\begin{align}
  \text{Med} &= \text{Med Only}\\
  \text{TT} &= \text{Temporary Total} &= m\\
  \text{Minor PP} &= \text{Minor Permanent Partial} &= y\\
  \text{Major PP} &= \text{Major Permanent Partial} &= x\\
  \text{PT} &= \text{Permanent Total} &= w\\
  \text{F} &= \text{Fatal} &= v\\
\end{align}$

Letter = \# of claims

## Variables in the Analysis

Looks at $\dfrac{\text{Claim Counts}_{Type}}{TT}$
  
* For every class code within the HG
* Look at TT claim as an exposure that could produce more severe claim

| ${\color{red}\Box}$ | ${\color{blue}\boxdot}$ | ${\color{green}\boxtimes}$  |
| ------ | --------- | ------------ |
| V      | v         | F Claims     |
| W      | w         | PT Claims    |
| X      | x         | Major Claims |
| Y      | y         | Minor Claims |

### For class code $i$ in year $t$

$m_{i,t} = \text{# of TT claims in class code } i \text{ in year } t$

* $i = 1, \ldots, R$  
$R = \text{# of classes in HG }h$
* $t = 1, \ldots, N$  
$N = \text{# of years in sample}$

$m_i = \sum\limits_{t=1}^N m_{i,t}$

${\color{red}\Box}_{i,t} = \dfrac{\text{# of } \boxtimes \text{ in class } i \text{ in year } t}{m_{i,t}}$

* Claim count relativity by class and year

${\color{red}\Box}_i = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^N m_{i,t}{\color{red}\Box}_{i,t}}{m_i}$

* Claim count relativity by class

### For HG $h$ in year $t$

$m_{h,t} = \text{# of TT claims in HG } h \text{ in year } t$

$m_h = \sum\limits_{t=1}^N m_{h,t} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^R\sum\limits_{t=1}^N m_{i,t}$

${\color{red}\Box}_{h,t} = \dfrac{\text{# of } \boxtimes \text{ in HG } h \text{ in year } t}{m_{h,t}}$

* Claim count relativity by HG and year

${\color{red}\Box}_h = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^N m_{h,t}{\color{red}\Box}_{h,t}}{m_h}$

* Claim count relativity by HG

Assumes variance ${\color{red}\Box}_i$ decreases as $m_i$ increases

## The Multi-Dimensional Credibility Procedure
<span style="color:red">Hard to test</span>

Goal:  
Estimate population mean using credibility weighted $V_i, W_i, X_i, Y_i$ $\Rightarrow$ $v_i, w_i, x_i, y_i$

Find credibility factors $b_{\boxdot,i}, c_{\boxdot,i}, d_{\boxdot,i}, e_{\boxdot,i}$

**Estimate of population mean:**

$\hat{\boxdot}_i = {\color{red}\Box}_h + b_{\boxdot, i}(V_i - V_h) + c_{\boxdot, i}(W_i - W_h) + d_{\boxdot, i}(X_i - X_h) + e_{\boxdot, i}(Y_i - Y-h)$

* If credibilities are 0 $\Rightarrow$ Estimate = HG ratios ${\color{red}\Box}_h$

To solve for $b_{\boxdot,i}, c_{\boxdot,i}, d_{\boxdot,i}, e_{\boxdot,i}$ for a given Injury Type $\boxdot$, solve the matrix below:

$\left[
  \begin{array}{c}
    Cov(V_i, \boxdot_i)\\
    Cov(W_i, \boxdot_i)\\
    Cov(X_i, \boxdot_i)\\
    Cov(Y_i, \boxdot_i)\\
  \end{array}
\right] = 
\left[
  \begin{array}{cccc}
    Var(V_i) & Cov(V_i W_i) & Cov(V_i, X_i) & Cov(V_i, Y_i)\\
    Cov(W_i, V_i) & Var(W_i) & & \vdots\\
    Cov(X_i, V_i) & & \ddots & \vdots\\
    Cov(Y_i, V_i) & \cdots & \cdots & \vdots\\
  \end{array}
\right]$
