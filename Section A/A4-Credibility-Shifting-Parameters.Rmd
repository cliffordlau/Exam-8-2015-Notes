## Standard Credibility Formula

$\text{New Estimate} = \text{Data} \times \text{Credibility} + (1 - \text{Credibility}) \times \text{Prior Estimate}$  
Prior Estimate = Class Avaerage *or* Previous Estimate for the *group*

## Question 1: Difference Between Risks?

**Test #1** for shifting parameters:  
Compare the average and $\sigma$ of the losing % of each team and see if it follows a binomial distribution

* Recall Binomial dist^n^ has $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$
* Data shows many teams are outside 2$\sigma$ from mean $\Rightarrow$ There are differences between teams
* There are correlation between years as well (tested below)

## Question 2: Loss % over timer just random fluctuations?

Is there risk parameters $\Delta$-ing overtime?

* **Test #2**, $\chi^2$ test:
    * $\chi^2 \: \text{Statistics} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dfrac{(Actual_i - Expected_i)^2}{Expected_i}$
    * n = Time Period
    * n-1 Degree of Freedom
    * If test stat > table value $\Rightarrow$ dist^n^ are different
    * $\Rightarrow$ Risk parameters have shifted

* **Text #3**, Correlations between years:
    1. Calculate the correlation for each team across time
    2. Take average of the correlation across all risk for each time seperation t
    3. If $\rho$ greater for smaller time seperations $\Rightarrow$ Shifting risk parameters $\Rightarrow$ Recent years can help predict the future
    
Recall:  
$\rho_{X,Y} = \dfrac{\mathrm{E[(X-\overline{X})(Y-\overline{Y})]}}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$

## Credibility Weighting Options
$\hat{X} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n Z_iX_i$  
$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n Z_i = 1$  
$\mu = \text{Grand Mean}$

6 Methods:

1. 0% credibiliy to all past data $\Rightarrow$ Every risk is average  
$\hat{X} = \mu$

2. 100% credbility to most recent year $\Rightarrow$ Most recent year repeats  
$\hat{X} = X_1$

3.
