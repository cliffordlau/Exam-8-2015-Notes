## Standard Credibility Formula

$\text{New Estimate} = \text{Data} \times \text{Credibility} + (1 - \text{Credibility}) \times \text{Prior Estimate}$  
Prior Estimate = Class Average *or* Previous Estimate for the *group*

## Question 1: Difference Between Risks?

**Test #1** for shifting parameters:  
Compare the average and $\sigma$ of the losing % of each team and see if it follows a binomial distribution

* Recall Binomial dist^n^ has $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$
* Data shows many teams are outside 2$\sigma$ from mean $\Rightarrow$ There are differences between teams
* There are correlation between years as well (tested below)

## Question 2: Loss % over timer just random fluctuations?

Is there risk parameters $\Delta$-ing overtime?

* **Test #2**, $\chi^2$ test:
    * $\chi^2 \: \text{Statistics} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dfrac{(Actual_i - Expected_i)^2}{Expected_i}$
    * n = Time Period
    * n-1 Degree of Freedom
    * If test stat > table value $\Rightarrow$ dist^n^ are different
    * $\Rightarrow$ Risk parameters have shifted
    * <span style="color:green">See 2012 Q8 </span>
* **Text #3**, Correlations between years:
    1. Calculate the correlation for each team across time
    2. Take average of the correlation across all risk for each time separation t
    3. If $\rho$ greater for smaller time separations $\Rightarrow$ Shifting risk parameters $\Rightarrow$ Recent years can help predict the future
    
Recall:  
$\rho_{X,Y} = \dfrac{\mathrm{E[(X-\overline{X})(Y-\overline{Y})]}}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$

## Credibility Weighting Options
$\hat{X} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n Z_iX_i$  
$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n Z_i = 1$  
$\mu = \text{Grand Mean}$

6 Methods:

1. 0% credibility to all past data $\Rightarrow$ Every risk is average  
$\hat{X} = \mu$

2. 100% credibility to most recent year $\Rightarrow$ Most recent year repeats  
$\hat{X} = X_1$

3. Credibility weight of last year vs $\mu$  
$\hat{X} = ZX_1 + (1-Z)\mu$

4. Equal weight to the n most recent years and rest to $\mu$  
$\hat{X} = Z\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n} + (1 - Z)\mu$

5. Exponential smoothing  
$\hat{X}_{i+1} = Z X_i + (1-Z) \hat{X}_i$

6. Most general form  
$\hat{X} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n Z_i X_i + \Big(1 - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n Z_i \Big)\mu$

## 3 Criteria to Select the Best Estimates

***Least Squared Error***

Lowest MSE of the actual vs prediction

BÃ¼hlmann/Bayesian
  
$MSE = \dfrac{SSE}{\text{# risks}}$

$SSE = \sum_{risks}(\hat{X}_{risks} - X_{i, risks})^2$

***Limited Fluctuation***

Small chance of large errors

Pr(Observed differs by more than a certain % from the predicted)

$\mathrm{Pr}\left(\dfrac{\big|\hat{X}_{risks} - X_{i, risks}\big|}{\hat{X}_{risks}} > k \% \right) < p$

***Meyers Dorweiler***

Correlation between $\frac{Actual}{Expected}$ and $\frac{Expected}{Mean}$

Confirms that there is no evidence that large predictions lead to large errors and small predictions lead to small errors

See Kendall's $\tau$ P.271 of paper (But not on syllabus)

***

First 2 tests are for minimizing errors whereas

The third one is to make sure you don't have correlation in your errors, pattern etc

## Final Points

When there are shifting risk parameters, older years will be less relevant $\Rightarrow$ Assign less credibility

Having a delay in getting historical data significantly increase the square error
