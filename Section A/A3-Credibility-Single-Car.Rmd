## Merit Rating Terminology

Based on # of full years since most recent accident

* $A: \space \geq 3 \text{yrs}$
* $X: \space = 2 \text{yrs}$
* $Y: \space = 1 \text{yr}$
* $B: \space = 0 \text{yrs}$

* $A + X: \space \geq 2 \text{yrs}$
* $A + X + Y: \space \geq 1 \text{yr}$

## Experience Rating Formula

$\text{E-mod} = ZR + (1 - Z)$

  * $Z = \text{credibility}$
  * $R = \dfrac{\text{Actual Loss}}{\text{Expected Loss}}$
      * $\text{Expected Loss} = \text{Past Experience}$

Usually solve for $\textbf{Z}$ with $\text{E-mod}$ and $R$  
R is based on prior policy term

Perfect Mod:

  * Based on experience in current policy period
  * Values of the Mod that result in equal ratios of $\dfrac{\text{# Claims}}{\text{premium}}$ across all merit ratings based on the *current* year data
  
## Calculating the Mod

Compare loss experience of the group within a class for which the Mod applies to the overall loss experience for the class

  * Use relative frequency instead of PP
      * $\dfrac{\text{# Claims}}{\text{On-level Premium}}$
      * PP is not used because the size of claims can cause fluctuation
      * Not using car years for denominator
      * Avoid exposure correlation with car years
  * Using Premium as the base only works if:
      * High frequency territories are also high average premium territories
      * Territorial rate differentials are proper (= LR across territories)

Mod Formula:

$\text{Mod} = \dfrac{\dfrac{\text{# Claims in }\textbf{group}}{\text{EP in }\textbf{group}\text{ @ present B rates}}}{\dfrac{\text{# Claims in }\textbf{class}}{\text{EP in }\textbf{class}\text{ @ present B rates}}} = \dfrac{\text{Group Frequency}}{\text{Class Frequency}}$

## Calculating R

* $\text{No Claims} \rightarrow R = 0 \rightarrow \text{Mod} = 1 - Z$
* All claims in the class are from 'B' ratings
* Use relative claim frequency (instead of relative losses)
* Claim Count $\sim$ Poisson

$\text{R} = \dfrac{\dfrac{\text{# Claims in }\textbf{group}}{\text{Car Yr in }\textbf{group}\text{ @ present B rates}}}{\dfrac{\text{# Claims in }\textbf{class}}{\text{Car Yr in }\textbf{class}\text{ @ present B rates}}} = \dfrac{\text{Group Frequency}}{\text{Class Frequency}}$  

* Note this is based on *Car Year*

$\text{R} = \dfrac{\dfrac{N \lambda}{N(1-e^{- \lambda})}}{\dfrac{N\lambda}{N}} = (1 - e^{- \lambda})^{-1}$  
$\lambda = \text{Class Total Frequency} = \dfrac{\text{# Claims from Class}}{\text{Earned }\textbf{Car Years}\text{ of Insured in Class}}$  
<span style="color:green">See 2005 Q3 </span>



Recall:
$\mathrm{Pr(X=x)} = \dfrac{\lambda ^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!} \Rightarrow \mathrm{Pr(X=0)} = e^{-\lambda}, \mathrm{Pr(X \geq 1)} = 1 - e^{-\lambda}$

## Conclusions

* Experience rating of a single car for 1 year has significant and measurable credibility for experience rating
* Individual risk experience is more credible when there is more variance in loss experience within a risk class (less refined risk classification system)
* Credibility for varying years of experience should increase in proportion to the # of years of experience (This test the point above)
    * Stability across time
    * Only for low credibility
    * The closer the credibility for 2 and 3 years of experience are to 2 and 3 times the 1 year credibility $\Rightarrow$
        * Less variation in the insured's $\mathrm{Pr(Accident)}$;
        * Less risk entering/ exiting the portfolio; 
        * Risk characteristics not changing much over time
    
## BÃ¼hlmaan Credibility

$Z = \dfrac{n}{n + k}$

$k = \dfrac{\mathrm{E[Var(X|\theta))]}}{\mathrm{Var(E[X|\theta])}} = \dfrac{\text{Expected Process Variance}}{\text{Variance of Hypothetical Mean}} = \text{Constant for different sample of n size??}$

If $X \sim Poi(\lambda), \space \lambda \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \Rightarrow k = \dfrac{\mu}{\sigma^2}$
