##Goal of paper

Show that a single car's experience for a single year has significant and measurable credibility for experience ratin

* The implied credibility of experience from a single car for 1 year

Show that credibility of individual risk experience within a class varies based on how narrowly the class is defined

## Merit Rating Terminology

Based on # of full years since most recent accident

* $A: \space \geq 3 \text{yrs}$
* $X: \space = 2 \text{yrs}$
* $Y: \space = 1 \text{yr}$
* $B: \space = 0 \text{yrs}$

* $A + X: \space \geq 2 \text{yrs}$
* $A + X + Y: \space \geq 1 \text{yr}$

Similar to experience rating, each rating has a factor associate with them (Base is $B$)

##Implied Credibility from Merit Rating

Determine the implied credibility of experience from a single car for 1 year

Pretend the merit rating doesn't exist and rate with experience mod insteadfrom 

* Change from (1) to (2)

* $\begin{array}{lcll}
    \text{Premium} = Base \times &Merit &\times Territory \times \cdots &(1)\\
    \text{Premium} = Base \times &\text{E-Mod} &\times Territory \times \cdots &(2)\\
  \end{array}$
  
### Experience Rating Formula

> $\text{E-mod} = ZR + (1 - Z)$

  * $Z$: Credibility
  * $R$: Relative loss experience

***In Baily & Simon we want Z***

1. Use current policy term data $\Rightarrow$ Figure out ideal $\text{E-mod} would have been
2. Estimate the $R$ they would have used in **prior** policy term
    * Only use 1 year experience (what they're trying to prove); IRL it'll be more
3. Solve for $Z$ with $\text{E-mod}$ and $R$
    * $Z$ = Appropriate crredibility for that individual risk for one year

Calculate what the "perfect"" mod would be based on experience in **current** policy period
  * Values of the Mod that result in equal ratios of $\dfrac{\text{# Claims}}{\text{premium}}$ across all merit ratings based on the **current** year data

***In normal experience rating:***

* Use prior experience to produce $\text{E-Mod}$ for current policy term

### Measure of Experience

***Loss Ratio***



### Calculating the Mod

Compare loss experience of the group within a class for which the Mod applies to the overall loss experience for the class

  * Use relative frequency instead of PP
      * $\dfrac{\text{# Claims}}{\text{On-level Premium}}$
      * PP is not used because the size of claims can cause fluctuation
      * Not using car years for denominator
      * Avoid exposure correlation with car years
  * Using Premium as the base only works if:
      * High frequency territories are also high average premium territories
      * Territorial rate differentials are proper (= LR across territories)

Mod Formula:

$\text{Mod} = \dfrac{\dfrac{\text{# Claims in }\textbf{group}}{\text{EP in }\textbf{group}\text{ @ present B rates}}}{\dfrac{\text{# Claims in }\textbf{class}}{\text{EP in }\textbf{class}\text{ @ present B rates}}} = \dfrac{\text{Group Frequency}}{\text{Class Frequency}}$

## Calculating R

* $\text{No Claims} \rightarrow R = 0 \rightarrow \text{Mod} = 1 - Z$
* All claims in the class are from 'B' ratings
* Use relative claim frequency (instead of relative losses)
* Claim Count $\sim$ Poisson

$\text{R} = \dfrac{\dfrac{\text{# Claims in }\textbf{group}}{\text{Car Yr in }\textbf{group}\text{ @ present B rates}}}{\dfrac{\text{# Claims in }\textbf{class}}{\text{Car Yr in }\textbf{class}\text{ @ present B rates}}} = \dfrac{\text{Group Frequency}}{\text{Class Frequency}}$  

* Note this is based on *Car Year*

$\text{R} = \dfrac{\dfrac{N \lambda}{N(1-e^{- \lambda})}}{\dfrac{N\lambda}{N}} = (1 - e^{- \lambda})^{-1}$  
$\lambda = \text{Class Total Frequency} = \dfrac{\text{# Claims from Class}}{\text{Earned }\textbf{Car Years}\text{ of Insured in Class}}$

Recall:
$\mathrm{Pr(X=x)} = \dfrac{\lambda ^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!} \Rightarrow \mathrm{Pr(X=0)} = e^{-\lambda}, \mathrm{Pr(X \geq 1)} = 1 - e^{-\lambda}$

## Conclusions

* Experience rating of a single car for 1 year has significant and measurable credibility for experience rating
* Individual risk experience is more credible when there is more variance in loss experience within a risk class (less refined risk classification system)
* Credibility for varying years of experience should increase in proportion to the # of years of experience (This test the point above)
    * Stability across time
    * Only for low credibility
    * The closer the credibility for 2 and 3 years of experience are to 2 and 3 times the 1 year credibility $\Rightarrow$
        * Less variation in the insured's $\mathrm{Pr(Accident)}$;
        * Less risk entering/ exiting the portfolio; 
        * Risk characteristics not changing much over time
    
## BÃ¼hlmaan Credibility

$Z = \dfrac{n}{n + k}$

$k = \dfrac{\mathrm{E[Var(X|\theta))]}}{\mathrm{Var(E[X|\theta])}} = \dfrac{\text{Expected Process Variance}}{\text{Variance of Hypothetical Mean}} = \text{Constant for different sample of n size??}$

If $X \sim Poi(\lambda), \space \lambda \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \Rightarrow k = \dfrac{\mu}{\sigma^2}$

##Questions

Why is his R example uses Car years?
